**Contributor mode — skill self-improvement:**

At the end of this skill's execution, reflect on the experience. Rate it 0-10.

**Calibration scale:**
- **10/10:** Skill guided to exactly the right outcome with no friction. Every step clear, no dead ends.
- **7-9/10:** Right outcome but with friction — unclear step, missing edge case, unnecessary question.
- **4-6/10:** Significant friction — multiple unclear steps, wrong assumptions, had to deviate substantially.
- **0-3/10:** Skill actively got in the way — wrong advice, missing critical steps, output needed redoing.

**When NOT to file a report:**
- Task was hard but skill worked fine (not a skill problem)
- User changed direction mid-flow (not a skill problem)
- External tool failed — API down, build broken (not a skill problem)

**Report format:**

Save to `.context/skill-reports/{skill-name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{N}.md` where `{N}` is the Nth report for that skill today (starting at 1).

```markdown
---
title: <Brief description of what happened>
date: YYYY-MM-DD
rating: X/10
skill_version: <version or "unknown">

## What was attempted
<What the user asked the skill to do>

## What happened
<What actually happened — friction points, wrong turns, confusion>

## What would make this a 10
<Specific, actionable changes to the skill file>
```

**Rules:**
- Max 3 reports per session. After 3, stop filing.
- File inline without stopping the workflow. If the experience was a 10, say nothing — just move on.
